# fullstack-typescript-example

This is an example application built with Create React App with TypeScript for the front end and using Express and TypeScript for the backend.

It includes a shared API module that insures type safety between the front end and back end.

## Getting started

This is a mono repo that uses Lerna to manage multiple packages.   Start the project in development mode:

```
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Development mode has live reload of all the modules such that as changes are made the application will reload or the browser will refresh keeping the runtime in sync with the live changes.

## Project Structure

The application is made up of three packages.

### server

### app

### api
